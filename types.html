        <h1>1. Low-level programming language</h1>
        <p>Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <h1>2. High-level programming language</h1>
        <p>High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language (execute the program).

            The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain.
            
            High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <h1>3. Middle-level programming language</h1>
        <p>Middle-level programming language lies between the low-level programming language and high-level programming language. It is also known as the intermediate programming language and pseudo-language.

            A middle-level programming language's advantages are that it supports the features of high-level programming, it is a user-friendly language, and closely related to machine language and human language.
