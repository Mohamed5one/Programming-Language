            <td>It was the first high level programming language designed for a computer but not used at that time. It is developed by Konrad Zuse, a German civil engineer and a computer enthusiast, for his Z1 computers between 1942 and 1945.            </td>
            <td>Autocode is the first ever compiled programming language developed by Alick Glennie in 1952 at the University of Manchester. The second version of Autocode called Mark 1 Autocode was developed by R. A. Brooker in 1955. Later, he has also developed Autocode for Mercury computers and it is called as Mercury Autocode. The next version EDSAC 2 Autocode was developed in 1961 which was noted for object code optimization and source code diagnostics which were advanced for the time.

            </td>
            <td>FORTRAN – FORmula TRANslation – was developed by a team led by John Backus at IBM during 1953-57. It is first widely used and oldest programming language which is still in use today. This language is primarily used in the fields where intensive computation is required such as Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), crystallography, computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, computational physics and computational chemistry.

                Smalltalk is one of the many object-oriented programming languages influenced by Simula. Smalltalk is designed by a team of Alan Kay in 1972 but publicly made available in 1980 as Smalltalk-80. Most of the object-oriented software design patterns which are currently in use are developed under Smalltalk envirornment. Among which most popular is Model-View-Controller pattern.


            </td>
            <td>C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1980. He analysed that Simula(an object-oriented programming language) has powerful features that are helpful for large software development and he combined those features with C and developed a new language called “C With Classes”. In 1983, he added some other new features like virtual functions, free memory allocation(new/delete), operator overloading, single line comments (//…) and rename it as C++. C++ is extensively used in embedded software, large commercial applications and video games.
